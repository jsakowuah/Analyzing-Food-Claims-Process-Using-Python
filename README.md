# food_claims_process analysis

Background of the Project.

Vivendo is a fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets. Customers often claim compensation from the company for food poisoning. The legal team processes these claims. The legal team has offices in four locations. The legal team wants to improve how long it takes to reply to customers and close claims. The head of the legal department wants a report on how each location differs in the time it takes to close claims.

Tasks

1. For every column in the data:
a. I state whether the values match the description given in the table above.
b. I state the number of missing values in the column.
c. I describe what you did to make values match the description if they did not
match.
2. I create a visualization that shows the number of claims in each location. Use the
visualization to:
a. I state which category of the variable location has the most observations
b. I explain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the
variable location
3. I describe the distribution of time to close for all claims. Your answer must include a
visualization that shows the distribution.
4. I describe the relationship between time to close and location. Your answer must
include a visualization to demonstrate the relationship.
